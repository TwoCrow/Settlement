# Settlement
Basic C program that generates random terrain descriptions in a console. In the future, it will be more fleshed out and allow you to expand and build a settlement through
text. I'm possibly going to change over to C#, since that's a much friendly language to code something like this in.

To compile and run:

Open a linux-flavored command terminal.
Navigate to the directory with the files found in this repository.
Type "gcc Settlement.c start.c reports.c manage.c init.c" and press enter.
Type "./a.out" and press enter.
